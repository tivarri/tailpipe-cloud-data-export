### AWS Integration Setup

**Automated Infrastructure Deployment for AWS**

Connect your AWS account to Tailpipe using our fully automated setup script. The script creates secure, read-only access to your AWS Cost and Usage Reports and CloudWatch metrics.

#### What Gets Created

Our setup script automatically provisions:

1. **S3 Bucket** - Stores your AWS Cost and Usage Report data
2. **Cost and Usage Report Export** - Hourly billing data with all cost allocation tags
3. **IAM Role** - Least-privilege, read-only access with External ID protection
4. **CloudFormation StackSets** (AWS Organizations only) - Deploys CloudWatch access to child accounts

#### Security & Privacy

- **Read-Only Access** - Cannot modify any AWS resources
- **External ID Protection** - Prevents unauthorized access (confused deputy attack prevention)
- **No Long-Term Credentials** - Uses IAM role assumption
- **Audit Trail** - All access logged in CloudTrail
- **You Stay in Control** - Remove access anytime with our cleanup script

#### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have:

- AWS CLI installed and configured ([Installation Guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/getting-started-install.html))
- `jq` command-line tool ([Installation Guide](https://stedolan.github.io/jq/download/))
- AWS account with Administrator access
- Your Tailpipe External ID (provided during onboarding)

#### Quick Start

**1. Download the Setup Script**

```bash
# Clone the repository (requires GitHub access)
git clone https://github.com/tivarri/tailpipe-cloud-data-export.git

### Google Cloud Platform Integration Setup

**Automated Infrastructure Deployment for GCP**

Connect your GCP billing accounts to Tailpipe using our automated setup script. Supports multiple billing accounts exporting to a single BigQuery dataset.

#### What Gets Created

Our setup script automatically provisions:

1. **GCP Project** - Dedicated project for billing exports
2. **BigQuery Dataset** - Stores billing data from all your billing accounts
3. **Cloud Storage Bucket** - Backup storage for billing data
4. **Service Account** - Secure access with Workload Identity Federation (keyless)
5. **IAM Permissions** - Least-privilege access to billing data

**Note:** Due to GCP API limitations, you'll need to manually configure the billing export in the Cloud Console (we provide step-by-step instructions).

#### Security & Privacy

- **Read-Only Access** - Cannot modify any GCP resources
- **Workload Identity Federation** - No service account keys required
- **Keyless Authentication** - Short-lived tokens (1 hour), auto-rotated
- **Least Privilege** - Minimal permissions required
- **Audit Trail** - All access logged in Cloud Audit Logs
- **You Stay in Control** - Remove access anytime with our cleanup script

#### Multi-Billing Account Support

A single project can consolidate billing data from multiple billing accounts. This simplifies management and reduces costs.

- Each billing account creates uniquely named tables in the same dataset
- Interactive selector during setup
- Support for organizations with multiple billing structures

#### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have:

- gcloud CLI installed and configured ([Installation Guide](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/docs/install))
- GCP account with Billing Account Administrator role
- Project Creator role (or existing project)

#### Quick Start

**1. Download the Setup Script**

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/tivarri/tailpipe-cloud-data-export.git
cd tailpipe-cloud-data-export/gcp
```

**2. Run the Setup Script**

```bash
# Interactive mode (recommended)
./setup-tailpipe.sh

# Or automated mode
PROJECT_ID=tailpipe-export \
BILLING_ACCOUNT=123456-789ABC-DEF012 \
REGION=us-central1 \
./setup-tailpipe.sh

# Preview changes first (dry-run)
DRY_RUN=1 ./setup-tailpipe.sh
```

**3. Configure Billing Export (Manual Step)**

The script provides detailed instructions for configuring the billing export in the Google Cloud Console. This takes 2-3 minutes and is a one-time setup per billing account.

**4. Share Configuration with Tailpipe**

The script outputs a JSON configuration containing your service account details and BigQuery dataset information. Share this with your Tailpipe account manager.

#### What Happens Next?

- GCP begins streaming billing data to BigQuery (near real-time)
- Tailpipe connects using Workload Identity Federation
- Your carbon emissions data appears in Tailpipe within 24 hours

#### Estimated Time

## FAQ Page

### Frequently Asked Questions

#### General Questions

**Q: Do I need to install any software?**

A: You only need the cloud provider's CLI tool (AWS CLI, Azure CLI, or gcloud) and our setup scripts. No agents or continuous software installations required.

**Q: Can Tailpipe modify my cloud infrastructure?**

A: No. All integrations use read-only permissions. Tailpipe can only read cost and billing data, never modify infrastructure.

**Q: How long until I see data in Tailpipe?**

A: Typically 24-48 hours. Cloud providers need time to generate the first cost export. Once data starts flowing, it updates daily (Azure), hourly (AWS), or near real-time (GCP).

**Q: Can I remove the integration later?**

A: Yes. Each cloud provider includes a cleanup script that safely removes all resources created during setup. The process takes 2-5 minutes.

**Q: Is the setup reversible?**

A: Completely reversible. Our cleanup scripts remove all infrastructure we created. Your existing cloud resources are never modified.

**Q: What if I have multiple AWS accounts / Azure subscriptions / GCP billing accounts?**

A: Our scripts fully support multi-account scenarios. AWS uses Organizations, Azure uses Management Groups or multiple subscriptions, and GCP supports multiple billing accounts in a single project.

#### Security Questions

**Q: What permissions does Tailpipe require?**

A: Tailpipe requires read-only access to:
- **AWS:** S3 bucket (Cost and Usage Reports) and CloudWatch metrics
- **Azure:** Storage account (cost exports) and optionally Cost Management API
- **GCP:** BigQuery dataset (billing export) and Cloud Storage bucket

**Q: How is my data protected?**

A:
- All data transfer uses encrypted connections (TLS 1.2+)
- Data at rest is encrypted using cloud provider default encryption
- Access is logged and auditable
- Tailpipe uses least-privilege permissions

**Q: Do you store my cloud credentials?**

A: No. We never store cloud credentials. Integrations use:
- **AWS:** IAM role assumption with External ID
- **Azure:** Managed Identity (keyless)
- **GCP:** Workload Identity Federation (keyless)

**Q: What about compliance (SOC 2, GDPR, HIPAA)?**

A: Our setup scripts create audit-compliant integrations. See our [Security Documentation](https://github.com/tivarri/tailpipe-cloud-data-export/blob/main/docs/security.md) for detailed compliance information.

#### Technical Questions

**Q: Can I customize the setup?**

A: Yes. All scripts support environment variables for customization. You can also modify the scripts directly - they're open source.

**Q: What if the script fails?**

A: Enable debug mode (`DEBUG=1 ./setup-tailpipe.sh`) and consult our [troubleshooting guide](https://github.com/tivarri/tailpipe-cloud-data-export/blob/main/docs/troubleshooting.md). Our support team is also available.

**Q: Do you support AWS GovCloud, Azure Government, or GCP Assured Workloads?**

A: Contact our support team for government cloud requirements. Special configuration may be needed.

**Q: Can I use Terraform/CloudFormation/ARM templates instead of scripts?**

A: Currently, we provide bash scripts for maximum compatibility. Terraform modules are on our roadmap. Contact us if you need IaC templates.

**Q: How do I update my integration?**

A: Pull the latest scripts from our GitHub repository and re-run the setup script. The script is idempotent and safely updates existing resources.
